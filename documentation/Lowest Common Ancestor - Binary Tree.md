### Description

> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
>
>According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

## Method

For my attempt via intuition see [[Lowest Common Ancestor - Binary Search Tree]] method one. However this is a rather low performance attempt so improvements must be made.
